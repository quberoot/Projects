[Dennis](/People.md) | Make recruiters pay for contacting potential cantidates for a postion. It could be just a few cents or more (or even zero cents if the candidate decides). Most recruiters anyway pay for job boards. Further let recruiters/employers pay for the time it takes to interview candidates. In my experience while job hunting I have found that recruiters and employers are just not serious enough about a candidates time. | Proportionate to the effort put in | There may be an arbitrator.
